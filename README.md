# rnetcat (rnc)

rnetcat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line. It is
a rewrite of the original `netcat` tool and incorporates features from the Nmap Project's Ncat, such as TLS support,
SOCKS5 proxying, and connection brokering.

This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use.
